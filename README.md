## Project Title: 
CovitFit: Boosting fitness during pandemic times 
## Target group of audience: 
Fitness tutors and tutees (eg. yoga, zumba, body workout, etc.)
## Target group of computing peripherals: 
3D - Depth Cameras

## Area of focus of redevelopment with supported reasoning: 
The team has come up with a simple and scalable solution that can be integrated with laptops used by the general public. The pandemic has prevented fitness classes like Yoga, Gym and Athletics from Running. This has forced tutors and tutees to move to online video platforms like Zoom and Google Meet. This however, has proven to be highly ineffective not only for the tutors, but the attendees as well. Some may not see the benefit of joining online zumba classes in comparison to having physical ones, thus dropping out and harming the business of the tutors. Others who do join, are not able to clearly follow the instructions of the coach and instructors. Some become lazy and inefficient and some do not follow the steps correctly, thus injuring themselves. These problems are avoidable when classes take place in-person. However, given the reality of the situation, it is best to come up with a more flexible plan that ensures both parties are benefited in the online learning process. This is where our solution comes into the picture. 

Our solution attempts to scale down the size of a Kinect like camera that can be easily integrated with the laptop. This high quality RGB-D camera provides skeletal tracking which would aid the instructors to better guide the participants to the right posture and movement. It provides a low-cost portable solution for the tutors and tutees to take a step ahead towards their fitness goals. We aim to integrate this low cost camera with a microcontroller to create a prototype that explains the key functionalities of the product.
